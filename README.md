# KattisJourney

Howdy! This repository hosts all of the code from my competitive programming course (CSCE 430). <br>

There are directories for the various programming strategies I've learned, such as fenwick trees and string algorithms, the weekly problem sets throughout the semester (e.g. pset2), and the 2 and a half hour long programming competitions that were held weekly (e.g. lab3). Inside of the problem set and competition directories are even more directories, each one representing a different problem to solve from Kattis (note: I did not solve ALL of the problems. some problems will have empty code). In order to get an A in my course, I had to solve 90% of the base amount of problems (the base for labs was 4-5 out of 8 problems, and the base for problem sets was usually 4 out of 5). Because I did achieve an A, most of the problems (around 60-70%) in this repo should be solved. To find a description, criteria, input, output, and test cases for a problem, you can simply search the title of it (the problem directory names are the problem titles) on Google or Kattis.
